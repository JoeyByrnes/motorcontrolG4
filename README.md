# motorcontrolG4
Ported Ben Katz's <a href="https://github.com/bgkatz/motorcontrol">motorcontrol firmware</a> from STM32f446 to STM32G474 (should work with any STM32G4 with minor edits)

This firmware is used on the OpenlegDrive. It should also work on the Moteus but I have not tested it, there may be a couple lines to change which I'd be happy to create a branch for, just reach out if you're interested.

The firmware may have bugs or small differences from the original motorcontrol code. Feel free to reach out if you're interested in using it.
